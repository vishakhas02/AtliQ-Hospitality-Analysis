As part of the codebasics september month resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project.

Link to the Challenge

Problem statement -

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Task List -
1. You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and insights required.
2. I uploaded the different data sets using pandas librabry.
3. Data cleaning - removed negative entries,
                   removed revenue outliers.
5. Data Transformation - calculating Occupancy Percentage for different room category.
6. Insights Generation (Adhoc Analysis) - Average Occupancy rate for different room category?
                                          Month by Month Revenue
                                          When was Occupany better? Weekday or Weekend?
                                          Avearge Occupancy rate per city.
                                    
Learnt things from this Project -
1. Learnt Hotel Chain bussiness key performance indicators with gaining domain knowledge
2. By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
3. How to import data sets using Pandas librabry.
4. Used functions like shape, unique(),Count(), describe(),merge() to perform Data Cleaning and Transformation.
5. Performed functions like min(), max(), std(),mean(),sum() to gnerated insights and performed adhoc analysis.

Some Important insights from the Analysis-
1. Mumbai generates the highest revenue followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi
2. Highest Occupancy rate is for Presidential room category followed by Premium, Elite, Standard
3. Occupancy is better at Weekends than Weekdays
4. Delhi tops both in occupancy and rating followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore
